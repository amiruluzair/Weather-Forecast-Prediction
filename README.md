# Weather Type Classification and Prediction Using Machine Learning Models
The primary objective is to accurately classify the weather conditions (Cloudy, Rainy, Snowy, Sunny) based on environmental data. This involves building and evaluating machine learning models to predict weather type using a variety of features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric pressure.
